# ICE Example project

This is an example project which uses ICE to deploy 26 canisters with complicated dependencies & setup in a single command.

## Quick start
```bash
npm i
dfx start --background
npx ice
```
From now on you can use `npx ice` to deploy the canisters. Or feel free to check out other commands with `npx ice --help`. And remember to peek into `ice.config.ts` to see how the canisters are defined.

I also recommend checking out the [VSCode extension for ICE](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dfinity.vscode-ice). It's pretty cool I think :)

Much more to come. Stay tuned.
